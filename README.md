<h1>Symbolic Algebra Lab</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I develop a Python framework for symbolic algebra. In such a system, algebraic expressions including variables and numbers are not immediately evaluated but rather are stored in symbolic form. These kinds of systems abound in the "real world," and they can be incredibly useful. Examples of similar systems include Wolfram Alpha and Sympy. <br />

I'll start by implementing support for basic arithmetic (+, -, *, and /) on variables and numbers, and then add support for simplification and differentiation of these symbolic expressions. Ultimately, this system will be able to support numerous interactions as shown below. <br />
